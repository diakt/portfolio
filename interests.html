Wildfire will worsen by several orders of magnitude over the next fifty years in the Pacific Northwest and Russia. I enjoy using statistical approaches in combination with significant assumption hunting to examine risk in maybe a systems theoretic context, and this passion has developed in tandem with my love for mathematics and computer science.</p>

The term bark beetle isn't a classification as much as a four-letter word for any of a class of ~6,000 insects that predate trees. They're currently blamed for exacerbating wildfires in the west by killing trees, mostly pine, spruce, and fir, and there appears to be almost no real evidence that bark beetles actually make fire risk or fire intensity worse.</p>
