Want to do a variety of things with sestup

#1 is definitely project integration, want to start with large teeeth

Kate and I need to find something that lines up well with mutual interest, perhaps finance related but always a soul-killing prospect 
Could run 311 fire data through NYC, the api would obviously be quick asl but I can't imagine it would be particularly interesting
Perhaps kate can swing on this, maybe twenty hours of work, thinking roman empire, grain shipments, who knows

I will admit that increased competence with git, control, etc. will help significantly
One swing at a time though

Would be Utah/Nevada border, Norcal, Idaho/Montana run, missed washington, Colorado run, one more but where...

Could include maybe brief directory on mountain pine beetle, but if I could keep it short or...
