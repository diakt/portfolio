Well, this is my personal webpage. I tried several themes out, but ended up settling on a fairly minimalist approach.

I wanted a base resume and project exhibit with some pictures, some pages to display a personal and background sense, and links to relevant platforms.
I wanted these links to be displayed cleanly and clearly.
I also wanted it to be be minimalist.

I used HTML, CSS, and JS. I ran four pages, with interests hopefully not interchangeable with projects. Had I done this again, I would have just wikipedia'd it into a single page with relevant subsections, but it is what it is. The JS is essentialy vestigial, and mostly for footer icons.

Main next steps involve transitioning the footer to a nav, given it's important to accessibility navigation. Top was properly formatted but I failed to do so otherwise. This would be a more interesting project if I had more to display.
