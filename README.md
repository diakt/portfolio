So I may have gone way too far on this before declaring my goals and approach. I want something clean, but we can calm down a little.

MVP - Minimum Viable Product

Your application must meet these requirements:
    Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
    Commits to Github every day.
    A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

The app must:
Have the following pages:
    home (greeting page)
    bio (your background)
    resume (past work experience)
    projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build -- we'll be adding to this as we build more applications in class)
    links (links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites you find interesting)
        optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
Use JS to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens). Write these from scratch. Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals). Don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, Bootstrap, etc.
Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).



ðŸ”µ Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):

    Create a complex user interface module (e.g. a carousel, modal, sticky nav, etc)
    Create an additional browser-based game (e.g. a quiz, choose your own adventure, battle game, etc)
    Research AJAX (covered later in this course) and create an app that displays interesting data from an external source (ask your instructor for a list of good sources)













MVP:
- Webpage with a header, footer, image, and central text loop
- Accessibility tagging
- Create other webpage models, keeping central template




Bronze:
- Separate webpages, though I'm unsure of how to do this
    - Background page, more of a my life to this point thing
    - Resume can link to google doc, a bit iffy on this
    - I could also make some of my more projects by request
- Social media links 
- Mobile optimization with media queries






Silver:
- Upgrading clickable html/sections to prettier things
- Footer with social media, iconed out as well
- Book recommendation model, just something quick and fun



Gold:
