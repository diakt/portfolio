        <!-- My dad had two pigs called hey you and who me -->
        <div class = "mid-child">
            <p class = "innertext">Well, saproxylic insect hello. My name is Gavin. My dad grew up on a farm and had two pigs called "Hey, you" and "Who, me". I'm a bit of a mutt, but I'd say I'm from Washington state. I graduated from Columbia with a degree in Mathematics, which was not exactly the plan going in. I'm more of an analyst than an algebraist, more of a probablist than an analyst, more of a fool than a probablist. I rowed for a while and fought wildland fire for a while. My favorite authors are Bulgakov, Pynchon, Kafka, Solzhenitsyn, and McCarthy, though probably not in that order.</p>
            <p class = "innertext"> I have a few niche interests. I know a good bit about bark beetles, a bit about rowing, and absolutely nothing about wildland fire.</p>
            <p class = "innertext">“Without turning, the pharmacist answered that he liked books like The Metamorphosis, Bartleby, A Simple Heart, A Christmas Carol. And then he said that he was reading Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Leaving aside the fact that A Simple Heart and A Christmas Carol were stories, not books, there was something revelatory about the taste of this bookish young pharmacist, who ... clearly and inarguably preferred minor works to major ones. He chose The Metamorphosis over The Trial, he chose Bartleby over Moby Dick, he chose A Simple Heart over Bouvard and Pecouchet, and A Christmas Carol over A Tale of Two Cities or The Pickwick Papers. What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.”</p>
