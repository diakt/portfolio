            <p class = "innertext">Well, hello. My name is Gavin. I'm a bit of a mutt, but I'd say I'm from Washington state. I graduated from Columbia with a degree in Mathematics, which was not exactly the plan going in. I'm more of an analyst than an algebraist, more of a probablist than an analyst, more of a fool than a probablist. I rowed for a while and fought wildland fire for a while. My favorite authors are Bulgakov, Pynchon, Kafka, Solzhenitsyn, and McCarthy, though probably not in that order. </p>
